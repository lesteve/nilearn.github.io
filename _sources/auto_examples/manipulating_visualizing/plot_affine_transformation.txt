Visualization of affine resamplings
===================================

This example shows how an affine resampling works.

A Nifti image contains, along with its 3D or 4D data content, a 4x4 matrix
encoding and affine transformation that maps the data array into millimeter
space. If (i, j, k) encodes an integer position (voxel) with the data array,
then adding 1 as a fourth entry, (i, j, k, 1), and multiplying by the affine
matrix yields (x, y, z, 1), a 4-vector containing the millimeter position of
the voxel.

The resampling procedure in `resample_img` can attribute a new affine matrix
and a new shape to your Nifti image while keeping its representation in
millimeter space exactly the same (up to sampling error and possible
clipping).

This example shows a 2D image in voxel space, and the position of the data in
millimeter space, as encoded by the affine matrix. The image is the resampled
in 3 ways and displayed in in millimeter space.

1) 4x4 affine matrix and target shape given
2) 3x3 transformation matrix (only new voxel axes, no offset)
   given and no shape given
3) 4x4 affine matrix given and no shape given

While 1) needs no further explanation (it returns an image exactly as
specified, with a new view on the data in millimeter space), 2) and 3) are
missing some specification, which is subsequently inferred by `resample_img`:
If the affine offset is missing (3x3 transformation, case 2), then the new
image will be the closest bounding box possible around the data along the
new axes. If the affine offset is given, but no shape provided, the
resulting image will be the closest bounding box around the union of the
data points and the affine offset.

Note that specifying a shape without specifying a 3x3 transformation matrix
causes an error message, because `resample_img` will not know where to start
the bounding box (there is no intelligent way of inferring this given the
bounding box shape).
